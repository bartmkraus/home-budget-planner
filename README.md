# Home Budget Planner
My personal project/lab for practicing programming and DevOps.

# Roadmap/plan:

1. A simple FastAPI application for adding things to the database (I definitely need to remember about the function that sets financial goals and the standardized data that will be sent to the database.)

2. Docker containers with database and Grafana.

3. Some message-oriented middleware.

4. This list will certainly grow.
